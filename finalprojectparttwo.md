# The Water Is Rising (Cont'd)
## How insurance factors into planning for flood-risk associated with climate change

Executive Summary (Revised):
On a personal level, there is only so much that we can do to make ourselves resilient to the effects of climate change. Sea-Level Rise (SLR) is one of the effects that will alter the lives of many people living on coasts, islands, as well as inland. Dr. Rick Spinrad, the administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), stated recently that, "The United States is expected to experience as much sea level rise in the next 30 years as we saw over the span of the last century‚Äù (The New York Times, 2022). So, how does one best prepare themself (and their families, when applicable) before the water is at their front door?

It is reported that "twenty-five percent of flood claims occur to homes outside of high-risk areas," and this number is only expected to rise as cities begin mitigating climate change. Water is a major factor in going forward. The federal safety-net, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), covers 95% od flood insurance policies, leaving only 5% to private insurance companies. While the federal program has a high participation rate of those that currently have insurance, the underlying issue is that only ten percent of homeowners have NFIP flood insurance nation wide. For this reason, greater awareness about protecting people's families and their dwellings from the threat that flooding poses, even where it is unexpected.

This project will focus on emphasizing the numbers that close the gap in states that are not necessarily known for their proximity to water, yet where scientists have identified potential flood risk in the future. I want the audience to takeaway that there are safety nets in place that they can lean into and not shy away from as planning becomes more necessary given the challenges facing our society. Often the message is that "climate change is scary," and in truth, it is. However, presenting people with tangible ways to be resilient to the risks that climate change poses seems like a more productive way to focus efforts.

### User Research Protocol

## a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story (in order by proirity)

  * People potentially in areas that are likely to be impacted by flooding (i.e. coastal areas)
  
  * Homeowners

  * People interested in learning about climate change mitagation on a more personal level, outside of          
  the typical messaging, such as "reduce, reuse, and recycle"
  
  * People generally interested in climate change that want to keep a diversified knowledge on the    
  issue

## b. My approach to identifying representative individuals to interview 

I knew that I wanted someone from my hometown of Houston, given the impact that flooding continues to have in the area. If they were a homeowner, it was an added bonus.

I also wanted the perspective of a policy student that I was least aware was interested in climate change issues. 

As sort of a baseline, I asked a randome associate in order to generally see what their thoughts were as well.

## c. your interview script; 



d. the findings from your interviews; and 
e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified.
