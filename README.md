hi! welcome to my public portfolio for my Telling Stories with Data course at CMU! I hope you enjoy the show ;)

# about me

my name is JaDa, and I'm a second year MSPPM student with a concentration in environmental policy. I really hope to work to ensure people have access to save, clean drinking water as climate change affects the amount of access that we have to water. ðŸ’¦
