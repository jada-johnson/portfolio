hi! welcome to my public portfolio for my Telling Stories with Data course at CMU! I hope you enjoy the show ;)

# about me

## howdy! ü§†  my name is JaDa (she/her).

I'm originally from Houston, TX, and I landed here at CMU by way of ungraduate in Los Angeles, CA. I'm a second year MSPPM student with a concentration in environmental policy. I really hope to work on securing access to safe, clean drinking water, especially as climate change affects the sort of access that we will have to such a vital resource. üí¶ 

of course, data in this sort of work will be incredibly important, given that more impactful work can be done if we are able to account for each and every droplet. furthermore, ensuring that decisionmakers are able to inform key decisions moving forward in our changing world üåé will also require keeping track of those at risk and all ready in need.

not everyone will be impacted, by way of privilege, access to technology, etc., but those who already are and will be soon are vulnerable beyond what most people can imagine. visualizing data around this topic makes it imaginable and helps action to be set in motion (hopefully!).

# what I hope to learn

numbers *can* be daunting, but they don't have to be. visualization helps!

I hope to learn how to especially tackle making such daunting information accessible and actionable. this means consistently taking in data from different perspectives and determining how to make it resonate with different audiences that will have different priorities.

I'm excited to be challenged in this course and really think outside the box(plot)! *badum tssü•Å*

## Visualizing Government Debt

# Government Debt by Country, 2017

<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6Smr" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6Smr" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2017</a></iframe> 

The above data visualization is produced by the OECD.

### Global GDP-to-Debt Ratios, 1995-2021

The above visual tracks the Debt-to-GDP Ratio for an assortment of countries around the world from 1995 through 2021 using data from the OECD. While each country may not have data for each year, one can see how in debted countries have become or avoided being over the last twenty-six years. 

### Global GDP-to-Debt Ratios, 2017

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11736509"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Above, the government indebtedness for an assortment of OECD Countries and their affiliates (light blue) are shown in comparison to the OECD government debt average (dark blue). The overall total OECD government debt ratio is shown in orange. The countries are respresentative of different forms of governments from five continents, so surely, the debt functions differently based on how the countries choose to finance it. 2017 is one of the most recent years in which the OECD had sufficient data on several countries; subsequently, that is why that year was chosen for this exercise. Furthermore, it allows for an easier comparison to the first chart produced directly from the OECD, which also focuses on 2017.

The middle chart ('Global GDP-to-Debt Ratios, 1995-2021') helps to separate information that would have been too convoluted on a singular line chart, while also allowing for comparison. It especially allows for comparison overtime, which neither of the other charts do. The added touch of the slight gray background adds a slight element that allows the audience to better visualize each country as opposed to a white background bleeding into the space between the individual charts. The color is vibrant enough to grab the audience's attention yet, hopefully, not overwhelming.

The graphs at the beginning and end represent the same information; however, I believe that they each emphasize different data points, the latter focusing on the OECD average and total, given that it would not be fair to assume that the debt ratio being high is necessarily bad. The OECD's bar chart highlights a few countries, seemingly at random, whereas the latter does not intend to make a distinction between the countries in that manner. Additionally, I think both emphasize which countries have more debt than others, based on the fact that data points are organized in an ascending order. However, neither indicates if a country is "worse off" than the next because additional information outside of the data points given are needed to come to that sort of conclusion.
