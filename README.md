hi! welcome to my public portfolio for my Telling Stories with Data course at CMU! I hope you enjoy the show ;)

# about me

## howdy! ü§†  my name is JaDa (she/her).

I'm originally from Houston, TX, and I landed here at CMU by way of ungraduate in Los Angeles, CA. I'm a second year MSPPM student with a concentration in environmental policy. I really hope to work on securing access to safe, clean drinking water, especially as climate change affects the sort of access that we will have to such a vital resource. üí¶ 

of course, data in this sort of work will be incredibly important, given that more impactful work can be done if we are able to account for each and every droplet. furthermore, ensuring that decisionmakers are able to inform key decisions moving forward in our changing world üåé will also require keeping track of those at risk and all ready in need.

not everyone will be impacted, by way of privilege, access to technology, etc., but those who already are and will be soon are vulnerable beyond what most people can imagine. visualizing data around this topic makes it imaginable and helps action to be set in motion (hopefully!).

# what I hope to learn

numbers *can* be daunting, but they don't have to be. visualization helps!

I hope to learn how to especially tackle making such daunting information accessible and actionable. this means consistently taking in data from different perspectives and determining how to make it resonate with different audiences that will have different priorities.

I'm excited to be challenged in this course and really think outside the box(plot)! *badum tssü•Å*

## Visualizing Government Debt

# Government Debt by Country, 2017

<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6Smr" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6Smr" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2017</a></iframe> 

The above data visualization is produced by the OECD.

### Global GDP-to-Debt Ratios, 1995-2021

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11735967"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

The above visual tracks the Debt-to-GDP Ratio for an assortment of countries around the world from 1995 through 2021 using data from the OECD. While each country may not have data for each year, one can see how in debted countries have become or avoided being over the last twenty-six years. 

### Global GDP-to-Debt Ratios, 2017

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11736509"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Above, the government indebtedness for an assortment of OECD Countries and their affiliates (light blue) are shown in comparison to the OECD government debt average (dark blue). The overall OECD government debt ratio is shown in orange. The countries are respresentative of different forms of governments from five continents, so surely, the debt functions differently based on how the countries choose to finance it. 2017 is one of the most recent years in which the OECD had sufficient data on several countries; subsequently, that is why that year was chosen for this exercise. Furthermore, it allows for an easier comparison to the chart above produced directly from the OECD, which also focuses on 2017.


The two graphs represent the same information; however, I believe that they each emphasize different data points.
