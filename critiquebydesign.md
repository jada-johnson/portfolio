# Critique by Design
## In this assignment, we were asked to critique an existing data visualization and redeisgn it using user input and our own intuition to determine what a better data visualization would look like.

### Part One: Finding a Visualization
It took some time, but I eventually across this data visualization from Our World In Data:
<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/distribution-electoral-democracy-vdem?time=1900&country=~OWID_HSE" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe> 

### Part Two: Critique the Data Visualization
I think this is an incredibly intricate data visualization, with a lot of moving parts (literally). However, in trying to convey so much data to its audience, this visualization can get a bit convoluted as the user tries to track so much information over a 232 year period, in which some countries do not exist yet or anymore. Assigning each region (continent) a color allows for the user to have more geographic context, but it is still difficult to follow over time -- especially as the bars move over time, when dragging the time timeline cursor. The same message could be conveyed with fewer frames 

Organizing the bars from most to least democratic aids the visual, but it's hard to compare. The great part about the tools that they embed into the visual is that you can choose to select countries; however, it still felt like the geographic aspect was missing. If the audience is well-versed in geography, then this visualization is entirely useful. Additionally, if they are more concerned with a count of how many countries fall into a range, without concern about visually locating the countries, this visualization is still incredibly useful. This is what prompted me to to take the following steps to redesign the visualization.

### Part Three: Sketch Out A Visualization
#### My solution was a choropleth map that would allow the user to absorb the same information over four frames: 1800, 1900, 2000, and 2021 (most current data).
