# Final: The Water Is Rising

## Reflection:
### Summary:
This project was meant to highlight the threat posed by flooding in a manner that made mitigation seem feasible to the everyday homeowner and people who may aspire to one day own a home. Climate change data can often be overwhleming, but to some degree, the information has to presented in a way that makes the issue seem pressing. I think highlighting how changing one aspect of someone's financial planning may save them a significant amount of money (and other hardships) in the long run. Geography is important factor in this data set, so a map is what made the most sense stylistically. While the data is useful, it would be more beneficial in the long run to have more granular data at a county level.

Showing how many of the homes have a flood risk piques one's interest, but if I could have had the county data available in a dataset, people could actually use this graphic to determine their immediate risk within the story. If anything, the maps as the visualization choice does a better job at just generally depicting the country's overall risk. The addition of the graphics in the beginning are meant to introduce the NFIP policies in a timely manner as a potential solution off-the-bat. Getting the story done as efficiently as possible, amkes the call-to-action of planning seem interactive and, better yet, doable.

Switching from the Flourish data visualization to Tableau, made two dimensions of information more obvious to the eye. I appreciate that people were willing to tell me to combine the initial sketches and show the financial aspect as well. Incoroprating that major change brought the issue to a close with action that poeple may be reluctant to do yet realize how climate chaneg will affect their wallets.
